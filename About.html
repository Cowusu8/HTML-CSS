  <h5 class="text-center">A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the
  division Angiospermae). The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a
  mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different
  individuals in a population) resulting from cross-pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same
  flower) when self-pollination occurs.A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the
